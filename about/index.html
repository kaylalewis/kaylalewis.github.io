  <h2>about</h2>
 
  <p class="content">Transelemental is an exploration of words under the poetic constraint of chemical properties. All words within Transelemental are formed from elemental abbreviations on the periodic table. By following this rule, the words inherit traits of the elements. The environment surrounding the word also affects the nature of its reactionâ€”all words are dynamic in space. Transelemental words can be paired to form poems and phrases, but when presented alone, a single word holds its own unique characteristics. </p>
