I wonder if artists and scientists truly share similar processes. Multiple iterations of works provide valid connection, but the pursuits themselves differ a great deal. I went to the lab on Friday and we sat down with Sid Nagel, who has been working in the physics department for over thirty years. I asked him what he thought about the attempts to draw connections between the artist and the scientist. He didn’t resort to the work process itself like many of the explanations I’ve encountered. Instead, he saw connection in what inspires the process in the first place. He likened it to a painter’s arbitrary reason for choosing a certain part of the landscape to study and paint and his own endeavors to study the way spilled coffee splashes: something resonates in these seemingly minuscule decisions. The processes that follow can be eloquently articulated. The drive behind these processes remains a mystery void of concrete explanation, but it’s ever-present. That drive is what the artist and the scientist share.
