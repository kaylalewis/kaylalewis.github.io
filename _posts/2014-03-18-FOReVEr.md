F<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>ReV<sub>2</sub>Er<sub>2</sub>
 can exist in a variety of chemical arrangements. The models below distribute the atoms so that they reach the closest level of stability. Currently, the composition of    
F<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>ReV<sub>2</sub>Er<sub>2</sub>
does not permit its creation in a lab: it is expensive and dangerous. Although the characteristics of the reaction in a physical environment canâ€™t be accurately described until the word is created, we can predict the sensual experience based off chemical properties.

Under the influence of heat, the metals in  
F<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>ReV<sub>2</sub>Er<sub>2</sub>
would soften and one interaction would create a gray-green solid. The remaining metals would shine silvery-white and retain structure, their forms resistant to heat. Certain oxides within
F<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>ReV<sub>2</sub>Er<sub>2</sub>
manipulate energy, and the reaction would take place at higher speeds.

F<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>ReV<sub>2</sub>Er<sub>2</sub>
was studied under the lens of ownership through the execution of a utility patent. The patent is currently in the drafting process and displayed below.
