Collaboration as a general concept was new to me before Transelemental. I grew up under the impression that my art needed to be mine and someone else’s presence invalidated it. I reached out to some scientists because they’re knowledgeable in completely different realms than me. I seek their input on what Transelemental means. I’ve witnessed a merge in subject matter and discipline. It’s beautiful and delicate because art and science don’t mesh in the books. I believe that they can. I’m not pressuring people to dive into foreign subjects, although I don’t discourage it. I am advising that we generate an awareness of all that’s around us. Don’t say that something is over your head. All you have to do is look up and you’ll see it.
