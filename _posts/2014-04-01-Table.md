The periodic table sits in front of me. I canâ€™t say exactly where this idea for a word stems. It could be something I heard during the course of the day, or part of an experience that resonates with me. I try to look past the word itself. I try to conjure a feeling for that word: the feeling that is beyond the word and cannot be articulated. When I look at the periodic table, I hold that feeling and something leads me to formulate words from the elements. Sometimes the word I form is a synonym of the word in my mind when I began. Sometimes the word is completely different: an antonym, something that belongs to another subject entirely, a noun instead of a verb; but that word carries the same feeling as the one I originally considered. What makes these words dynamic comes before I study their chemical properties. They stem from things that I cannot put into words. They hold so much more than a line in the dictionary.
