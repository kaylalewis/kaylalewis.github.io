The next endeavor at University of Chicago will be to build P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>. Andrzej is captivated by Pâ€™s luminescent properties. He saw an acoustic characteristic to Te that also seemed interesting. P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub> contains a lot of elements with striking properties, although the effects of their combinations need researched further before P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub> can be built.
